# Simplette CSS Stylesheet

Simplette is a relatively basic CSS stylesheet whose main purpose is to provide a simple and yet functionnal set of styles that make it easier to generate webpages with a consistent appearance.

One of the main "advantages" is the fact that there is no hidden margins paddings or spacings, you have to manually toggle/enable them when and where you want them.<br>
This might seem a bit cumbersome, but it makes it easier to generate a web page with a consistent appearance without having to fight the stylesheet itself.<br>
And whatever spacing you chose to enable will always be the same value: 1em (Expect for the 2 classes)</p>

## Elements & Classes

All of the classes and their effect are documented on the [demo page](https://aziascreations.github.io/Simplette-CSS-Stylesheet/).
